Outputs from Hazard Disaggregation
==================================

The OpenQuake engine output of a disaggregation analysis corresponds to the combination of a hazard curve and a 
multidimensional matrix containing the results of the disaggregation. For a typical disaggregation calculation the list 
of outputs are the following::

	user@ubuntu:~$ oq engine --lo <calc_id>
	id | name
	**3** | Disaggregation Outputs
	5 | Full Report
	6 | Realizations

Running ``--export-output`` to export the disaggregation results will produce individual files for each site. In 
presence of a nontrivial logic tree the user can specify the realization on which to perform the disaggregation by 
setting the ``rlz_index`` parameter in the ``job.ini`` file. If not specified, the engine will compute the mean 
disaggregation across all realizations. NB: before version 3.17 the default algorithm used was different: only the 
realization closest to the mean hazard curve was selected and used perform the disaggregation. This was a choice forced 
by performance limitations that do not apply to recent versions of the disaggregation calculator.
